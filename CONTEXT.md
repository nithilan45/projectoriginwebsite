# Project Origin — Context

## What Problem We're Solving

Immigrant and first-generation students rarely get real chances to explore entrepreneurship. They often lack:

- access to founders/mentors and startup networks,
- safe spaces to take creative risks,
- programs at school that teach building and pitching,
- confidence to share ideas in rooms that don't reflect their background.

Talented students end up on the sidelines while peers pitch and prototype. Project Origin exists to change that.

## What Project Origin Does

Origin Challenge is a 5-week, student-run bootcamp + pitch day for immigrant high schoolers.
Students: identify a problem, design a prototype in Figma, build a scrappy MVP (AI/no-code allowed), create a short slide deck, and pitch to mentors/judges—many immigrants themselves.

Outcome: tangible work (prototype + slides), real feedback, confidence, and community.

## Brand, Look & Feel (Logo-Led)

Anchor the visual style to the logo.

- **Primary color**: Deep Origin Blue (same as logo)
- **Background**: very light mint/ice (same as the screenshot)
- Keep pages clean and typographic so the globe + wordmark carry the brand
- **Typography**: one modern sans (e.g., Inter or Poppins). Headlines bold, body regular
- **Imagery**: real student/mentor photos when available; otherwise keep it minimal so the globe mark shines
- **CTAs**: buttons in Origin Blue on the mint background; short labels like Apply Now

## Pages & Content (short, skimmable)

### Home
- Hero: wordmark + globe, one-sentence mission, Apply Now button
- "What You'll Do" (Design → Build → Pitch)
- "Why It Matters" (access, representation, confidence)
- Mentors preview grid
- Final CTA

## Homepage Sample Copy

**Tagline**: Build. Demo. Pitch.

A student-run incubator for immigrant students looking to get into entrepreneurship. In 5 weeks, turn your idea into a demo and tell your story with confidence.

**Why It Matters**: Great ideas are everywhere. Access isn't. Project Origin closes that gap with mentors who share your journey and a structure that gets you building fast.

## Globe Animation (the one "wow" moment)

**Goal**: one tasteful, logo-matching globe animation that makes the brand feel alive—without distracting from content.

**Visual style**: same wireframe pattern as the logo (deep blue lines on mint background).

**Where to place** (choose one):
- Hero centerpiece behind/next to the wordmark, or
- Section divider between "What You'll Do" and "Why It Matters"

**Behavior** (simple & smooth):
- Slow continuous rotation (approx. 1 revolution per 45–75 seconds)
- Slight light-and-shadow sweep to give depth (very subtle)
- Optional hover: globe pauses or drifts 2–3° to acknowledge the pointer
- Respect reduced motion: if a user prefers less motion, show a static globe

**Fallbacks**:
- If animation can't load, display the static globe in the same spot
- Keep file lightweight so pages stay fast

## Proof Points on Page

- Mentor headshots/logos with short bios
- One or two student quotes after the first cohort
- Clear judging rubric snapshot on the program page

## Success Looks Like

- First screen instantly communicates mission + CTA
- The site visually mirrors the globe + Origin Blue identity
- The single globe animation feels premium, not flashy
- Mentors feel proud to be featured; students feel invited and capable
- Easy path to Apply from every page

## Color Scheme

Based on the logo:
- **Primary**: Deep Origin Blue (from logo)
- **Background**: Very light mint/ice (from logo background)
- **Globe**: Wireframe pattern in Deep Origin Blue
- **Text**: Deep Origin Blue for headings, darker shade for body text
- **CTAs**: Deep Origin Blue buttons on mint background

## Typography

- **Headlines**: Bold weight
- **Body text**: Regular weight
- **Clean, typographic approach** to let the globe + wordmark carry the brand
