        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p>You've designed your solution. Now it's time to build something real. But don't spend months perfecting every detail—instead, build an MVP. In this lesson, you'll learn what an MVP really is and why building less can help you learn more.</p>

            <h2>What is an MVP?</h2>
            
            <p>MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's the simplest version of your product that allows you to start learning from real customers.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept</h4>
                <p>An MVP is not a crappy product. It's the smallest thing you can build that delivers real value to customers and lets you test your most important assumptions.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The key words are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> The smallest scope that can still be useful</li>
                <li><strong>Viable:</strong> Actually delivers value to customers (not just a demo)</li>
                <li><strong>Product:</strong> Something real that customers can use</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Lean Startup Philosophy</h2>

            <p>The MVP concept comes from the Lean Startup methodology, popularized by Eric Ries. The core idea:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.</blockquote>
                <cite>— Eric Ries, The Lean Startup</cite>
            </div>

            <p>Traditional approach: Spend months building → Launch → Hope customers like it</p>
            <p>Lean approach: Build small → Learn from customers → Iterate → Repeat</p>

            <p>This is called the Build-Measure-Learn loop:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Build:</strong> Create the smallest thing that tests your assumption</li>
                <li><strong>Measure:</strong> See how customers actually respond</li>
                <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Decide what to do next based on data</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why Build an MVP?</h2>

            <h3>1. You're Probably Wrong</h3>
            <p>Most startup assumptions are wrong. The product you imagine customers want is rarely what they actually need. An MVP helps you discover this quickly and cheaply.</p>

            <h3>2. Customers Can't Tell You What They Want</h3>
            <p>People are bad at predicting their own behavior. Showing them something real gets you much better feedback than asking hypotheticals.</p>

            <h3>3. Time is Your Scarcest Resource</h3>
            <p>Every week you spend building features nobody wants is a week wasted. An MVP gets you to learning faster.</p>

            <h3>4. Perfect is the Enemy of Good</h3>
            <p>You'll never feel "ready" to launch. Waiting for perfection means waiting forever.</p>

            <h2>Famous MVPs</h2>

            <p>Even billion-dollar companies started with embarrassingly simple MVPs:</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Dropbox</h4>
                <p>Before building the actual product, Drew Houston made a 3-minute video demonstrating how Dropbox would work. The video got 75,000 signups overnight—proving demand before writing a single line of sync code.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Airbnb</h4>
                <p>The founders rented out air mattresses in their own apartment and created a simple website with photos. No booking system, no payments—they just wanted to see if anyone would actually pay to stay.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Zappos</h4>
                <p>Nick Swinmurn tested if people would buy shoes online by going to local stores, photographing shoes, and posting them on a website. When someone ordered, he'd go buy the shoes and ship them. No inventory needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Buffer</h4>
                <p>Joel Gascoigne created a simple landing page describing Buffer's features with a pricing page. Before building anything, he tested if people would click "buy." They did—so he built it.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Types of MVPs</h2>

            <h3>1. Landing Page MVP</h3>
            <p>A simple page that describes your product and captures email signups or pre-orders.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Is there interest? Will people give you their email?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Buffer's pricing page before the product existed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Explainer Video MVP</h3>
            <p>A video showing how your product would work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Do people understand the concept? Does it excite them?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Dropbox's demo video</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Concierge MVP</h3>
            <p>Deliver the service manually instead of building technology.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Will people pay? What do they actually need?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Manually matching users before building an algorithm</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Wizard of Oz MVP</h3>
            <p>Looks automated to customers, but you're actually doing the work manually behind the scenes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Does the product concept work?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Zappos buying and shipping shoes manually</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Piecemeal MVP</h3>
            <p>Combine existing tools (Typeform, Zapier, Airtable) to create your product without coding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Does the workflow solve the problem?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Using Calendly + Zoom + Stripe for a coaching service</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Single-Feature MVP</h3>
            <p>Build one core feature really well instead of many features poorly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Is the core value proposition compelling?</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Instagram started as just photo filters + sharing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Defining Your MVP Scope</h2>

            <p>The hardest part of building an MVP is deciding what to include and what to leave out.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Riskiest Assumption</h3>
            <p>What's the biggest unknown that could kill your startup? Your MVP should test this first.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do people have this problem? (Should have tested in Phase 1)</li>
                <li>Will they pay for a solution? (Test with pricing)</li>
                <li>Can we actually deliver the value? (Test with a working product)</li>
                <li>Will they use it repeatedly? (Test retention)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Define the Core Value</h3>
            <p>What's the ONE thing your product must do? If you had to describe your product with one verb, what would it be?</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>The "One Thing" Test</h4>
                <p>Your MVP should do ONE thing well. If a customer uses your MVP and that one thing works, they should feel value. Everything else can wait.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Cut Everything Else</h3>
            <p>Once you've identified the core value, be ruthless about cutting everything that isn't essential to delivering it.</p>

            <p>Ask for each feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can we launch without this? (If yes, cut it)</li>
                <li>Does this test our riskiest assumption? (If no, cut it)</li>
                <li>Would customers still get value without this? (If yes, cut it)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Minimum ≠ Mediocre</h4>
                <p>"Minimum" doesn't mean low quality. Your MVP should be small in scope but polished in execution. A single feature that works beautifully is better than five features that are all buggy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="activity-box">
