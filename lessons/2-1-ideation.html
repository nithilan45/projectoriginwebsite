        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p>You've identified and validated a problem worth solving. Now comes the fun part: generating ideas for how to solve it. In this lesson, you'll learn proven techniques to generate creative solutions and evaluate which ones are worth pursuing.</p>

            <h2>The Ideation Mindset</h2>
            
            <p>Before diving into techniques, let's establish the right mindset for ideation:</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Rule</h4>
                <p>Separate idea generation from idea evaluation. First, generate as many ideas as possible without judgment. Then, evaluate them. Mixing these two phases kills creativity.</p>
            </div>

            <p>During brainstorming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantity over quality:</strong> More ideas = better chance of finding great ones</li>
                <li><strong>No criticism:</strong> "That won't work" is banned. Every idea is valid.</li>
                <li><strong>Wild ideas welcome:</strong> Crazy ideas often lead to practical breakthroughs</li>
                <li><strong>Build on others:</strong> "Yes, and..." instead of "No, but..."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Brainstorming Techniques</h2>

            <h3>1. The "How Might We" Method</h3>
            <p>Reframe your problem as a "How Might We" (HMW) question. This opens up possibility instead of focusing on constraints.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Reframing as HMW</h4>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> First-generation college students don't have access to application advice from people who've been through it recently.</p>
                <p><strong>HMW questions:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                    <li>How might we connect students with recent graduates?</li>
                    <li>How might we make expert advice more accessible?</li>
                    <li>How might we capture and share knowledge that exists but isn't documented?</li>
                    <li>How might we make the application process less overwhelming?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>2. The 10x Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>Force yourself to generate at least 10 different solutions. The first few will be obvious. By #7-10, you'll start thinking more creatively.</p>

            <p>If you're stuck, try these prompts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What if it was a service instead of a product? (or vice versa)</li>
                <li>What if it was free? How would we make money differently?</li>
                <li>What if we only served 100 people really well?</li>
                <li>What would the opposite solution look like?</li>
                <li>What would [successful company] do?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. SCAMPER Method</h3>
            <p>SCAMPER helps you generate ideas by looking at existing solutions through different lenses:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>S - Substitute:</strong> What can we substitute or swap?</li>
                <li><strong>C - Combine:</strong> What can we combine or merge?</li>
                <li><strong>A - Adapt:</strong> What can we adapt from other industries/contexts?</li>
                <li><strong>M - Modify:</strong> What can we magnify, minimize, or change?</li>
                <li><strong>P - Put to another use:</strong> How else could this be used?</li>
                <li><strong>E - Eliminate:</strong> What can we remove or simplify?</li>
                <li><strong>R - Reverse/Rearrange:</strong> What if we reversed the process?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Constraint-Based Ideation</h3>
            <p>Paradoxically, adding constraints can boost creativity. Try generating solutions with artificial limitations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"What if we could only use text messages?"</li>
                <li>"What if the entire product had to fit on one screen?"</li>
                <li>"What if users could only spend 2 minutes a day on it?"</li>
                <li>"What if we had to launch in one week?"</li>
                <li>"What if it had to work without the internet?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Reverse Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>Instead of asking "How do we solve this?", ask "How do we make this problem WORSE?" Then reverse those ideas.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Reverse Brainstorming</h4>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Students are stressed about college applications.</p>
                <p><strong>How to make it worse:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                    <li>Give them more confusing, contradictory advice</li>
                    <li>Make deadlines even more unclear</li>
                    <li>Remove any human support</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reversed into solutions:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                    <li>Create a single, curated source of trusted advice</li>
                    <li>Build a clear timeline with all deadlines in one place</li>
                    <li>Provide personal mentorship from someone who's been there</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Evaluating Your Ideas</h2>

            <p>Once you have a list of ideas (aim for 15-20+), it's time to evaluate them. Here are frameworks to help:</p>

            <h3>The ICE Framework</h3>
            <p>Score each idea 1-10 on three dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> How big would the impact be if this works?</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> How confident are you that it will work?</li>
                <li><strong>Ease:</strong> How easy is it to test or build?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Multiply the scores (I × C × E) to get a priority score.</p>

            <h3>The Feasibility-Desirability-Viability Test</h3>
            <p>Every good solution needs to pass three tests:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Desirable:</strong> Do people actually want this? (You validated this in Phase 1)</li>
                <li><strong>Feasible:</strong> Can you actually build/deliver this?</li>
                <li><strong>Viable:</strong> Can you build a sustainable business around this?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept</h4>
                <p>The best startup ideas sit at the intersection of desirability, feasibility, and viability. Missing any one of these means the idea won't work.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Questions to Ask About Each Idea</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Does this directly address the validated problem?</li>
                <li>Could I build a simple version of this quickly?</li>
                <li>Would my early adopters be excited about this?</li>
                <li>Do I have any unfair advantage in executing this?</li>
                <li>Does this feel different from what already exists?</li>
                <li>Could this scale if it works?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Pivot vs. Persevere</h2>

            <p>As you evaluate ideas, you might realize your initial direction isn't quite right. That's okay! Here's how to think about pivoting:</p>

            <p><strong>Consider pivoting if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer interviews reveal a different, more urgent problem</li>
                <li>Your idea can't pass the feasibility or viability tests</li>
                <li>Someone else is doing the exact same thing much better</li>
                <li>You keep finding reasons why this won't work</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Persevere if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer excitement is high</li>
                <li>You have a unique angle or advantage</li>
                <li>The challenges are solvable with more effort/creativity</li>
                <li>You feel genuinely excited about the solution</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>The only way to do great work is to love what you do.</blockquote>
                <cite>— Steve Jobs</cite>
            </div>

            <h2>Narrowing Down to Your Best Idea</h2>

            <p>After evaluation, you should have 2-3 promising ideas. To pick one:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sleep on it.</strong> Let your subconscious process. Which idea do you keep thinking about?</li>
                <li><strong>Talk to potential customers.</strong> Describe each idea briefly. Which one gets the strongest reaction?</li>
                <li><strong>Consider your motivation.</strong> Which problem are you most passionate about solving? Startups are hard—passion helps you persist.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> After all the analysis, sometimes you just know.</li>
            </ol>
