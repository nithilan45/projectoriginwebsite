        </div>

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p>The best startup ideas don't come from trying to think of "the next big thing." They come from deeply understanding problems that real people face every day. In this lesson, you'll learn systematic ways to discover problems worth solving—starting with your own community.</p>

            <h2>Why Start with Problems?</h2>
            
            <p>Many first-time entrepreneurs make the mistake of falling in love with a solution before understanding the problem. They think of a cool app or product, build it, and then wonder why no one uses it.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Key Concept</h4>
                <p>Successful startups solve real problems for real people. The bigger and more painful the problem, the more valuable the solution.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Starting with problems gives you several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You know there's demand before you build anything</li>
                <li>You can talk to potential customers from day one</li>
                <li>You stay focused on creating value, not just cool features</li>
                <li>It's easier to explain and sell your product</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where to Find Problems</h2>

            <h3>1. Your Own Life</h3>
            <p>The problems you experience firsthand are your best starting point. You understand them deeply, you know when they occur, and you feel their pain directly.</p>
            
            <p>Ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What frustrated me today?</li>
                <li>What took longer than it should have?</li>
                <li>What did I wish existed?</li>
                <li>What did I complain about to someone?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <blockquote>The best problems to solve are the ones you have yourself. You'll understand them better, and you'll be more motivated to solve them.</blockquote>
                <cite>— Paul Graham, Y Combinator</cite>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Your Community</h3>
            <p>Your family, friends, school, and neighborhood are rich sources of problems. Pay attention to what people around you complain about or struggle with.</p>

            <p>Your immigrant community, in particular, may face unique challenges that mainstream solutions don't address:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Language barriers in accessing services</li>
                <li>Navigating unfamiliar systems (healthcare, banking, education)</li>
                <li>Staying connected with family abroad</li>
                <li>Finding culturally appropriate products or services</li>
                <li>Career challenges unique to your community</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Specific Groups You Belong To</h3>
            <p>Think about all the groups you're part of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students at your school</li>
                <li>Members of clubs or teams</li>
                <li>People who share your hobbies</li>
                <li>Your generation (Gen Z)</li>
                <li>People with similar goals or interests</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each group has its own set of problems. Your membership gives you insider knowledge that outsiders don't have.</p>

            <h2>The 5 Whys Technique</h2>

            <p>When you spot a problem, don't stop at the surface. Dig deeper to find the root cause using the "5 Whys" technique—a simple but powerful tool developed at Toyota.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works: When you identify a problem, ask "Why?" Then ask "Why?" again to that answer. Repeat five times.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <h4>Example: The 5 Whys in Action</h4>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Students at my school are stressed about college applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Why #1:</strong> Why are they stressed? → Because they don't know if they're doing the right things.</p>
                <p><strong>Why #2:</strong> Why don't they know? → Because college advice is confusing and contradictory.</p>
                <p><strong>Why #3:</strong> Why is it confusing? → Because most advice comes from people who went through the process decades ago.</p>
                <p><strong>Why #4:</strong> Why is that a problem? → Because the college application process has changed dramatically.</p>
                <p><strong>Why #5:</strong> Why hasn't advice kept up? → Because there's no easy way for recent applicants to share what actually worked for them.</p>
                <p><strong>Root Problem:</strong> Students lack access to relevant, up-to-date college application advice from peers who recently went through the process.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The 5 Whys helps you move from surface-level symptoms to the underlying problem. Often, the real opportunity lies several levels deeper than what's obvious.</p>

            <h2>Problem Interview Basics</h2>

            <p>The best way to understand problems is to talk to people who have them. This is called "problem interviewing" or "customer discovery."</p>

            <h3>How to Conduct a Problem Interview</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set the context:</strong> Explain you're trying to understand challenges people face in [specific area]. You're not selling anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask about their life:</strong> Start broad. "Tell me about how you currently [relevant activity]."</li>
                <li><strong>Dig into problems:</strong> "What's the hardest part about that?" "What frustrates you most?"</li>
                <li><strong>Understand frequency and severity:</strong> "How often does this happen?" "What does it cost you when it does?"</li>
                <li><strong>Learn about current solutions:</strong> "What do you currently do about this?" "What have you tried?"</li>
                <li><strong>Listen more than you talk:</strong> Your job is to learn, not to pitch your ideas.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Questions to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "Would you use [your idea]?" — People are bad at predicting their future behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "Would you pay for this?" — They'll often say yes to be nice</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ask:</strong> Leading questions that suggest the answer you want</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Makes a Good Problem?</h3>

            <p>Not all problems are worth solving as a business. Here's what makes a problem attractive:</p>

            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 24px 0;">
                <thead>
                    <tr style="background: var(--bg-tertiary);">
                        <th style="padding: 16px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid var(--border-light);">Factor</th>
                        <th style="padding: 16px; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid var(--border-light);">What to Look For</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);"><strong>Painful</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);">People actively complain about it and seek solutions</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);"><strong>Frequent</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);">It happens regularly, not just once in a while</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);"><strong>Urgent</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);">People want to solve it now, not "someday"</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);"><strong>Expensive</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 14px; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-light);">It costs people time, money, or emotional energy</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 14px;"><strong>Widespread</strong></td>
                        <td style="padding: 14px;">Many people have this problem, not just a few</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The more of these factors a problem has, the more likely people will pay for a solution.</p>

            <h2>Your Unique Advantage</h2>

            <p>Remember: your background gives you special insight into problems that others can't see. Problems that affect immigrant communities, for example, are often overlooked by mainstream entrepreneurs who don't experience them.</p>

            <p>Some successful companies built on immigrant insight:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remitly:</strong> Founded to make sending money to family abroad easier and cheaper</li>
                <li><strong>Duolingo:</strong> Created by a Guatemalan immigrant to make language learning accessible</li>
                <li><strong>WhatsApp:</strong> Built by Ukrainian immigrants to help people communicate internationally for free</li>
            </ul>
